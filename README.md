# React Application

This is a simple React application.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>


2. Navigate into the project directory

cd react-application


3. Install dependencies using npm 

npm install


4. To start the application, run the following command

npm start

This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser. 
If it doesn't open automatically, you can access the application at http://localhost:3000 in your browser.


Additional Notes
* Make sure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your machine.
* This application was bootstrapped with Create React App.
* For production deployment, you can build the application using npm run build

Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of your Git repository. This README provides clear instructions on how to install dependencies and start the application, along with additional notes for developers.
